# Contributing to the Project

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth process.

## Branching Strategy

- **`main`**: This is the production branch. Do not push directly to it.
- **Feature Branches**: Create a new branch from `main` for each new feature. Use the naming convention `feat/short-feature-name` (e.g., `feat/user-authentication`).
- **Fix Branches**: For bug fixes, use the naming convention `fix/bug-description` (e.g., `fix/login-button-bug`).
- **Chore/Docs/CI**: For other tasks, use `chore/`, `docs/`, or `ci/` prefixes.

## Commit Messages

- Use conventional commit messages (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`).
- Keep messages concise but descriptive.

## Pull Requests

- All changes must be submitted via a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch.
- Fill out the PR template with as much detail as possible.
- Ensure all CI checks are passing before requesting a review.
